# Internet Access and Educational Outcomes in Rural Communities  
Ethan Heine  

This project aims to analyze the relationship between internet access and educational outcomes in rural communities, using American Community Survey (ACS) data and U.S. Department of Education EDGE data.  
## Overview  
The goal of this project is to understand the impact of limited internet access on academic outcomes between rural and urban communities. We utilize Cenpy to access the ACS data from the Census Bureau API, and Pandas for data cleaning, analysis, and visualization. We also use Department of Education EDGE data to compare with the ACS data, specifically by looking at educational outcomes of students in struggling districts.
